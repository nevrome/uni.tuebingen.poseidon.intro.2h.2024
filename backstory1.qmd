# Hunt for the Ice mummy

It is the year 2024 in an alternative universe. You are a student of archaeogenetics at Tübingen university. One cold February afternoon you receive a cryptic email from your professor. You have not seen him for months, when he had left for an expedition in the Tyrolean Alps.

> My dear student,
> 
> we made an incredible discovery at 46.77° N, 10.83° E! You have to look at this data immediately. I will contact you, when I know more.
>
> Best,
> CP

Attached you find multiple files. First this incredible photograph:

But then also genotype data files in EIGENSTRAT format:

```{filename="ice.ind"}
ice	M	iceG
```

```{filename="ice.snp"}
rs3094315	1	2.013e-2	752566	G	A
rs12124819	1	2.0242e-2	776546	G	A
rs28765502	1	2.2137e-2	832918	C	T
rs7419119	1	2.2518e-2	842013	G	T
rs950122	1	2.272e-2	846864	C	G
...
```

```{filename="ice.geno"}
0
0
2
2
0
...
```

They seem to feature the SNPs for a single individual. Few missing values, certainly enough to work with.

You are justifiably concerned about the ethical implications of working with a sample you know so little about, but you put these concerns aside for the moment. You want to get to the bottom of this mystery first.
