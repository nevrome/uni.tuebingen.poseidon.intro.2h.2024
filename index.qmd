This website was created to support a ~2h demonstration of Poseidon and some of its tools, features and components for students and other practitioners of archaeogenetics. Read more about Poseidon at <https://www.poseidon-adna.org/>.

The introduction begins with the overview slides below, then shows some concrete applications and workflows on the command line, motivated by a little narrative framework.
